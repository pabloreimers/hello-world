# hello-world
This is me doing the github tutorial to start doing version control in literally my second year of grad school, years after I have considered myself "good at coding"

Oh boy no I have to write a bit about myself I donno my mantis just molted on my desk that was pretty cool it was like the 4th molt I think.
